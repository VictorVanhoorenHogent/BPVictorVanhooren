  abstract = {In a modern, agile, software development team, the goal is to get software made in a timely manner. To achieve this, these teams usually rely on tools Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery to automate a lot of work for them. New code is automatically tested and integrated with code from other systems to check whether no new bugs are introduced, and a deployment of a new build to production can happen with the click of a button or even automatically. Each of these steps has their own tools that work together to achieve the final goal of bringing new features to production. Having so many tools does come with security risks: how do these tools work together? What data is sent from each tool to another? What would happen if an attacker took over a tool? This paper aims at delivering a framework for detecting and preventing security vulnerabilities in Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipelines in the context of a large consultancy company which provides Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery environments as a service to customers and internal development teams. Some exploratory research is done on how CI/CD is used within the company, and together with experts from the company, the framework is built. The end result is a baseline which the company can use to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities in their platform.},

  abstract    = {Continuous deployment pipelines assist in achieving the goal of rapid, repeatable, and reliable software releases. A deployment pipeline automatically builds, deploys, tests and releases software. Since the pipeline is a significant part of an organisations end-to-end software delivery process, the security of the pipeline is essential. This study investigates potential threats and vulnerabilities in a continuous deployment pipeline and evaluates the severity of them in a quantitative way. Threats and vulnerabilities were identified by assessing previous literature on the subject and by having risk identification sessions with experts. 25 different threats and vulnerabilities were identified. The severity estimation was based o
